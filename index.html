        <p>Terrestrial LiDAR Survey Report</p>

<p>Objective: To collect and acquire terrestrial LiDAR data for an as-built survey.</p>

<p>Crew and roles:                Brandon Wildman – assistant and manages the orientation and leveling of equipment
                                                Neil McLaughlin – operator of the Leica P20 for stations: (2)
                                                Yahya (John) Saeed – main operator of the Leica P20 for stations: (1, 3, 4, 5)
                                                Zhi Jian (Jim) Liang – manages the orientation of the targets and assistant</p>

<p>Equipment:        Leica P20
                                Twin Target
                                2 – 6 inch HDS targets
                                2 – 3 inch HDS targets
                                Tripod
                                Leica Cyclone software</p>

<p>We start off with a Leica P20 scanner that we place outside of the K wing. We started with leveling our tripod after placing the scanner on top and then start the typical setup for the P20. In the beginning, we take our twin targets and apply it with two targets facing towards the scanner. They allow us to collect LiDAR data in a . We have placed our twin target beside the entrance to the K wing and have remained at that location for all of our scans. Other targets used in our setup were the conventional 6 inch HDS targets, which was placed south of the parking lot before the muster point sign. As usual, we have placed these targets on a tripod and our twin target with an included tripod.</p>

<p>For our setup, we have placed our stations for our as-built survey around the entrance of the K wing of Senator Burns. We have placed our setups in the following locations: one near the entrance of the K wing (1), one between the K wing and the parking lot (5), one in a field southwest of the K wing (2), one in the southeast of the K wing and south of the parking lot (3), one within 100 m from location 2 (5), and one . We have placed our stations within the range required (100 m) for LiDAR scans and placed them with a set distance from our targets. Initially, we had placed our second setup so close to our setups that we had to move our station further away and move the targets as well.</p>

<p>bstacles of the area that we have set up were people passing by our scans, ourselves sitting and standing in the scans, stationary objects such as cars, poles, and other man-made objects. We have removed them through taking artefacts in Leica Cyclone as part of our post-processing procedure. We are interested in using a high resolution scan of the ground and landscape south of Senator Burns building, particularly around the K wing and to the access way to the parking garages in the west. We are interested in natural features such as trees, foliage, slopes, sides of buildings, and other objects within our scans. </p>
